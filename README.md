# About Me

## Introduction
My name is John Victor! I've been a C#/.NET programmer for about 6 years now and I've mostly been working on personal projects in that time... This means that I haven't got a job in the area until now, and I've been living with other things and also doing occasional freelance work for to live...

Well, I have a lot of skills and small details. I could never go to college or anything like that, but I can easily make a program of any kind in a few hours, I can think in terms of algorithms and design complex system archetypes almost instantly like any good programmer... doesn't seem to be of much use unfortunately, hahahahahaha... people unfortunately like embellished papers more than giving people chances. Well, that doesn't matter here, this is a session about me and these are details about me!

## Great Projects
Some of the projects I'm most proud of right now, and which are on GitHub (I haven't had it in a long time, unfortunately I didn't know it would be something that important until I needed it), are:
 * [Iza Blockchain](https://github.com/JoaoVictorVP/Iza-Blockchain): A blockchain, literally, that I'm building to serve as a cheaper second layer to the BSC or any network I can use to write more "permanent" data for a game of mine. Well, that was the initial idea, I've been studying a lot about cryptography and I've been having more and more different thoughts about what to do next, I believe it will evolve and overcome some problems of current blockchains.
 * [Nipah Tokenizer](https://github.com/JoaoVictorVP/Nipah-Tokenizer): An advanced text tokenizer that can be used both to interpret simple messages and to create complex language neutral code analyzers, its simplicity and ease of use allow anyone to create a small functional scripting language in a few minutes.
 * [Mii.NET](https://github.com/JoaoVictorVP/Mii.NET): A framework that seeks to make extensive use of the new features of .NET 6+, with types like NativeArray, SpanStack, NativeString, and more, you can effortlessly utilize native-level memory manipulation and take the pressure off the GC.
 * [Nipah Source Generators](https://github.com/JoaoVictorVP/NipahSourceGenerators): A collection of utilities for C# source generators that aim to facilitate the work of creating and maintaining the generated code at compile time with pre-defined types and facilities such as TypeBuilder, MethodBuilder and InvokeBuilder.
 * [Nipah Firebase](https://github.com/JoaoVictorVP/NipahFirebase): An advanced system for handling and managing Firebase databases (in the future possibly of a much wider range), so it is no longer necessary to rely exclusively on manual CRUD operations on all relevant properties and objects (instead, the powerful source generators design their objects so they can be used in a simple and straightforward way, as well as deleted when needed!).
 * [Nipah Crypto](https://github.com/JoaoVictorVP/NipahCrypto): Last but not least, an extremely important project for future technology, an implementation of the SPHINCS+ framework (and possibly one of XMSS and maybe a few others later) for C#, which will allow virtually anyone to use it. these cryptographic digital signature systems without relying on bindings and the like, while maintaining excellent system-level performance.

## Help-me with my work!
You can help me with my work either making code changes here on Github or helping me buy a cup of coffee, I would be very grateful for both!
